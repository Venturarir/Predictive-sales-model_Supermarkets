# Prototyping-with-ML
This is a project I developed to prototype some ideas for prototyping master's class
## Descriptions of files;
Product Positioning.csv -> Data used<br>
Dashboard.py -> File with the dashboard code to execute<br>
Model predict demand.ipynb -> File with the prediction model <br>
Similarity Function.ipynb -> File with the similarity model <br>

All other docs are directly the pkl files models used in the 'Dashboard.py'
